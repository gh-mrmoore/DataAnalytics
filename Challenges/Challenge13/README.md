# Earthquake Mapping

## Background
Information will almost always need to be presented visually. There are a variety of media for these presentations, including, but not limited to, graphs, charts and maps. Maps provide an excellent means for displaying information when there are geographical factors at play.

## Overview
Are the more earthquakes on the East Coast of the United States or the West Coast? Is there a pattern to the strongest measured earthquakes? These are questions that can be readily examined by mapping data. By displaying information on a map, trends may be found that may indicate differences between areas. While other factors may be at play (say, job distribution relative to distance from the sea for dock workers), the ease of examining data on map cannot be overstated. While charts or graphs may give a better representation of change over time (or other comparisons), change by area and region are best viewed on a map.
