## Overview of Project

### Background
An API (application programming interface) is a common way to both obtain and share information. By creating or accessing an API, the transfer of information may be facilitated more easily. APIs have a variety of uses and benefits, including, but not necessarily limited to:
* Standardizing the transfer of information.
* Simplifying the transfer of potentially large datasets.
* Improving the separation between code and data (as in front-end web applications runnign separately from back-end applications).

### Purpose
Learning to incorporate multiple datasets and utilize data from one API call to initiate or improve another API will be an important skill to master. By using OpenWeatherMap and Google Maps, we can create a more detailed representation of location data and enhance the user experience.
