### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The only significant difficulty encountered was familiarizing myself with the COUNTIFS function. Having never used it before, I built it out slowly and had to re-write the conditions a time or two to fit the parameters of the analysis.

#### Potential Difficulties
Some potential difficulties could include:
- Creating the pivot table with the correct monthly breakdowns for successful, failed and canceled campaigns.
- 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
### First Conclusion
The highest number of campaigns and the highest success rate of campaigns occured during the months of May, June and July over the period of the data provided (2009 - 2017). To increase the likelihood of a successful campaign, it could be beneficial to launch the campaign during one of these months.
### Second Conclusion

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
### First Conclusion
Barring some outlying data points, the highest percentage of successful campaigns are those with the relatively lower campaign goals. Almost 85 percent of campaigns in the dataset were for goals of $9,999 or less, with an average success rate of almost 70 percent. For campaigns with goals of $10,000 and above, the success rate falls to 45 percent.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations of this analysis include:
- The specific focus on Kickstarter. There are other platforms for crowdfunding (indiegogo, gofundme, patreon, etc). Including information from those sources could better inform the overall analysis. Additionally, including data from additional sources could yield better fundraising results following a comparative analysis.
- The categories were determined by data, presumably, entered by the campaign creator and could have had some information incorrectly classified for the purposes of our analysis. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Further investigate outcomes based on goals using smaller goal increments and incorporating analysis over time.
- Comparative analysis of outcomes to include country of origin. Perhaps different types of campaigns are more successful in different locations.
