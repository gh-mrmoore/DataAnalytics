# PyPoll

## Overview of Project
This project will examine election results to validate the results of a recent Colorado election. Votes were accepted using three formats: mail-in ballots, punch card ballots read by machine and direct recording electronic ballots. Counts have been tabulated, but current methods could be improved. This examination will also serve as certification of the vote.

### Background
An audit was requested for recent election results in three Colorado counties, Denver, Araphoe and Jefferson. The purpose of this audit was to certify vote counts only while also verifying the declared winner. Using simple Python algorithms and specified widely-used libraries, the data provided will be examind and compared to the results tabulated during the election.

### Purpose
The purpose of this audit is to verify the vote counts obtained during the election and to familiarize the election team with command line operations as well as with text editors such as Visual Studio Code.

## Election Audit Results

* Number of votes and percentage for each county
    * Arapahoe County: 6.7% (24,801)
    * Denver County: 82.8% (306,055)
    * Jefferson County: 10.5% (38,855)
* County with largest number of votes
    * Denver County: 306,055
* Vote breakdown by candidate
    * Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
    * Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
    * Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
* Winning candidate and details
    * Diana DeGette 73.8% (272,892 votes)

## Summary
The purpose of the audit was very finite in scope. No data verification or data cleaning was performed. To expand the potential use of this audit script, at least two major modifications should be made.

### Clean and Validate Data
Adapting the script to verify and validate the ballot information would help insure the integrity of our data and, therefore, the integrity of the election. Multiple votes with the same ID (or other unique identifier) would cause errors in the final result(s) generated by the program. Duplicate or invalid data can be caused by a variety of factors, very commonly errors in data entry.

### Limited User Prompts
To adapt the script to larger datasets would be useful in making this script functional for state-wide or even national elections. By programming in flexibility for the columns of data coming in from the file, the program could be easily modified, on the fly, for varying datasets with different column organization. Adding limited user prompts to verify which column(s) of data should be used in the analysis would reduce the amount of data editing prior to the analysis. This could be easily accomplished using an <code>input</code> statement and/or lists generated from the files being audited.

### Changing Variable Names and Output
A relatively minor change would be to change the output of the script and the variable names used within the scripts. In the current program, 'county' or 'counties' is used to summarize the data. If this script were used for other jurisdictions, these variable names might not be appropriate. The command line and text output is also identified at the county level (whether singular or plural). Changing the wording here would create a more universal output.
