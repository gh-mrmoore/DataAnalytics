## Summary

Without more information regarding population density and mileage per trip, a full analysis will be somewhat lacking or based largely on assumptions. For the purpose of this summary and for the recommendations request, the following assumptions will be made:
* Average mileage per trip will be sequentially higher moving from Urban to Suburban to Rural settings.
* Population density will higher moving from Rural to Suburban to Urban (most dense).
* There are either no differences in fare rates (such as peak rates or higher rates during evening hours), or these rates are insignificantly different or, with further analysis, would not impact the analysis.
