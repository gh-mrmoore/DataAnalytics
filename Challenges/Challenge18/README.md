# Crypto Cluster

## Background
Unsupervised machine learning is beneficial when there is no pre-determined outcome or easily labeled data.

## Overview
Use unsupervised machine learning to determine the trading market and create a classification system for possible investment. Clustering the data provided allows our algorithm to predict the grouping based on the available input.

## Results
Although no easy recommendations can be made, the data was able to be broken down in to 4 distinct clusters. Eliminating currency that is not being traded, currency where there are no mined coins or no coin supply cleans up the data and allows for better grouping.
