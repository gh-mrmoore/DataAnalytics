Basic REGEX matching.

Regex.Matches method will be used repeatedly.

search an input string for all occurrences of a regex and returns all the matching results

use \n (new line) to create rows in a dataframe from a text file or something similar

search_term = ''
text_df[text_df['text].str.contains(search_term)]

if we want to look for a trailing space:
search_term = 'term\s'
